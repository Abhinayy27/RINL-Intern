Prediction-and-Forecasting-Skin-Temperature-of-Blast-Furnace

Chained models to predict and forecast the skin temperature of blast furnaces.
This model predicts the skin temperature of the furnace on a 6-month real time dataset taken at a interval of 10 seconds every time.
Achieved 97% accuracy using KNN Regressor and 96% accuracy using Neural Networks
